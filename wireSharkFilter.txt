To capture I'll use tshark and wireshark to filter:
tshark -i enp5s0 -a duration:secondsToCapture -w outputName.pcapng

This is for non-tor traffic:
((ip.src == externIp and ip.dst == externIp) and (gsm_ipa or tcp.dstport == 5000)

This is to remove ssh traffic:
!(tcp.port == 55782 and tcp.port == 22 and ip.addr == externIp)

Tor traffic (setup and send/reciving):
(ip.src == 127.0.0.1 and ip.dst == 127.0.0.1 and ((tcp.port == 9051 or tcp.srcport == 9050) or (gsm_ipa and tcp.port == 5000)))
